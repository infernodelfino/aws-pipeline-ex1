phases:
  # The 'install' phase is a good place for dependencies if you had any (e.g., npm install)
  install:
    commands:
      - echo "No install commands needed for simple static site"
  # The 'build' phase is where you'd run frontend builds (e.g., npm run build)
  build:
    commands:
      - echo "No build commands needed for simple static site, files are in source root"
artifacts:
  files:
    # This collects all files and subdirectories from the root of your source repository
    # and places them directly into the root of the build artifact ZIP.
    - '**/*'
  # The discard-paths: yes ensures that the source folder structure is not preserved,
  # but rather the artifacts are placed at the root of the zipped artifact.
  # This is often default behavior for 'files' but good to be explicit.
